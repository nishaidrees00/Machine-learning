# Machine-learning
In this project we detect fraudulent trasantion using deep learning models i.e.

1. Artificial Neural Network
2. Convolutional Neural Network

We use Synthetic Financial dataset that is available on Kaggle. 
The link is given below.

The dataset is higly imbalanced, use SMOTE technique to balance data.
In data Preprocessing use Standard scaler and Train test split method.
For evaluation, use confusion matrix, AUC_ROC curve, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
